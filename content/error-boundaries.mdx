## What Are Error Boundaries?
Error boundaries are special React components that catch JavaScript errors **during rendering**, **in lifecycle methods**, and **in constructors** of components **below them** in the component tree. Instead of causing the entire application to crash, error boundaries log the errors and render a **fallback UI**.

---

## Why Use Error Boundaries?
### 1. Prevent Full Application Crashes
Without error boundaries, an error in one component can cause the entire application to break. Error boundaries allow **graceful degradation** by catching errors and displaying an alternative UI.

### 2. Isolate Errors to Specific Components
Error boundaries confine errors to the component subtree where they occur, preventing them from affecting unrelated parts of the application.

### 3. Log Errors for Debugging
They provide a structured way to **log errors** (e.g., sending them to an external logging service like Sentry or LogRocket) to help diagnose and fix issues.

---

## When Not to Use Error Boundaries
- **Event Handlers**: Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers. You need to use **try-catch** within event handlers.
- **Asynchronous Code**: Promises and async functions are not caught by error boundaries. Use `.catch()` for handling promise rejections.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Error boundaries do not catch errors during SSR since they only work in the browser.

---

## Implementing an Error Boundary
Error boundaries are **class components** that use the lifecycle methods `static getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch` to catch and handle errors.

### Example: Error Boundary Components
<Tabs items={['Class Component', 'Function Component']}>
  <Tab value="Class Component">
    ```jsx
    import React from "react";

    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
      }

      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // Update state so the next render shows the fallback UI
        return { hasError: true };
      }

      componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        console.error("Error caught by Error Boundary:", error, info);
        // You can log the error to an external service here
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          return <h2>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</h2>;
        }
        
        return this.props.children;
      }
    }

    export default ErrorBoundary;
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Function Component">
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

    const ErrorBoundary = ({ children }) => {
      const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false);

      useEffect(() => {
        const errorHandler = (event) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          setHasError(true);
        };
        
        window.addEventListener("error", errorHandler);
        return () => window.removeEventListener("error", errorHandler);
      }, []);

      if (hasError) {
        return <h2>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</h2>;
      }

      return children;
    };

    export default ErrorBoundary;
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Wrap your components inside the `ErrorBoundary` to catch errors and prevent crashes.

```jsx
import ErrorBoundary from "./ErrorBoundary";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices
- Wrap high-risk components (e.g., third-party components, dynamic UI elements) with an error boundary.
- Log errors to an external service for monitoring and debugging.
- Provide a meaningful fallback UI to improve user experience.

By implementing error boundaries, you can build more **resilient** and **user-friendly** React applications.
