## What are HTTP Methods?

HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs, define the type of action a client wants to perform on a server resource. Each method maps to a specific operation in CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), forming the foundation of RESTful APIs.

These methods are standardized in the HTTP protocol and are essential for client-server communication.

## Common HTTP Methods

### **GET**
- **Purpose:** Retrieve data from the server.
- **Safe:** Yes
- **Idempotent:** Yes
- **Example:** Fetch a user's profile
```http
GET /users/1 HTTP/1.1
```

### **POST**
- **Purpose:** Send data to the server to create a new resource.
- **Safe:** No
- **Idempotent:** No
- **Example:** Registering a new user
```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jeremy",
  "email": "jeremy@example.com"
}
```

### **PUT**
- **Purpose:** Update a resource by replacing it entirely.
- **Safe:** No
- **Idempotent:** Yes
- **Example:** Update user details
```http
PUT /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jeremy",
  "email": "newjeremy@example.com"
}
```

### **PATCH**
- **Purpose:** Update part of a resource.
- **Safe:** No
- **Idempotent:** Not guaranteed
- **Example:** Change only the email field
```http
PATCH /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "patched@example.com"
}
```

### **DELETE**
- **Purpose:** Remove a resource from the server.
- **Safe:** No
- **Idempotent:** Yes
- **Example:** Delete a user
```http
DELETE /users/1 HTTP/1.1
```

## Less Common HTTP Methods

### **HEAD**
- Like `GET` but returns only headers (no body).
- Useful for checking if a resource exists or to retrieve metadata.

### **OPTIONS**
- Returns the allowed HTTP methods on a resource.
- Commonly used in CORS preflight requests.

### **CONNECT**
- Used to establish a network connection.
- Often for tunneling HTTPS traffic through proxies.

### **TRACE**
- Echoes the request for diagnostic purposes. 
- Rarely used and often disabled for security reasons.

## Safe and Idempotent Methods Explained

- **Safe**: A method is considered *safe* if it doesn't modify the server state. (`GET`, `HEAD`)
- **Idempotent**: An *idempotent* method can be called multiple times without changing the result. (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`)

## Choosing the Right HTTP Method

When building RESTful APIs or working with web services, selecting the correct method improves clarity, security, and caching behavior.

| Method | Use for | Safe | Idempotent |
|--------|---------|------|------------|
| GET    | Reading data | ✅ | ✅ |
| POST   | Creating data | ❌ | ❌ |
| PUT    | Replacing data | ❌ | ✅ |
| PATCH  | Updating data | ❌ | ❌ |
| DELETE | Deleting data | ❌ | ✅ |
| HEAD   | Metadata fetch | ✅ | ✅ |
| OPTIONS| Method check | ✅ | ✅ |

## Final Thoughts

HTTP methods are the backbone of modern web and API communication. Using them correctly ensures your applications are robust, predictable, and standards-compliant. Whether you're debugging requests or designing a REST API, a deep understanding of these verbs is a must-have tool in your developer toolkit.
