## What is Shallow Comparison?
Shallow comparison checks whether two variables reference the same memory location rather than their actual content.

### Example: Shallow Comparison
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
const obj2 = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false (different memory references)
```
In this case, `obj1` and `obj2` have identical properties, but since they are stored in different locations in memory, the comparison returns `false`.

## What is Deep Comparison?
Deep comparison checks whether two objects or arrays contain the same values, including nested structures.

### Example: Deep Comparison
```javascript
function deepEqual(objA, objB) {
  return JSON.stringify(objA) === JSON.stringify(objB);
}

const obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
const obj2 = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(deepEqual(obj1, obj2)); // true
```
Here, we compare the stringified versions of both objects, which checks their actual content rather than memory reference.

## Differences Between Shallow and Deep Comparison
| Feature           | Shallow Comparison        | Deep Comparison        |
|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Checks**       | Memory reference         | Actual content         |
| **Performance**  | Faster                   | Slower                 |
| **Use case**     | Checking if objects are the same instance | Ensuring all values inside objects or arrays match |

---

## When to Use Which?
- Use **shallow comparison** when you only need to check if two variables refer to the same object.
- Use **deep comparison** when verifying if objects or arrays have identical values, including nested properties.

By understanding these concepts, you can choose the appropriate comparison method based on your JavaScript use case.
