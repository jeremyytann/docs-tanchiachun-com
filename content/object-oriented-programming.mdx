## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (fields or properties) and code (methods or functions).

Instead of writing procedures and functions that operate on data, OOP organizes software design around data, or objects, and a set of well-defined interfaces to that data.

OOP is widely used because it promotes modularity, code reuse, scalability, and a clearer structure, especially for complex programs.

## Key Concepts of OOP

### 1. **Class**

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}
```

### 2. **Object**

An **object** is an instance of a class.

```javascript
const dog = new Animal("Buddy");
dog.speak(); // Buddy makes a sound.
```

### 3. **Inheritance**

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

```javascript
class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const pet = new Dog("Max");
pet.speak(); // Max barks.
```

### 4. **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

```javascript
function animalSpeak(animal) {
  animal.speak();
}

const cat = new Animal("Whiskers");
const doggo = new Dog("Bolt");

animalSpeak(cat); // Whiskers makes a sound.
animalSpeak(doggo); // Bolt barks.
```

### 5. **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can protect the internal state of the object.

```javascript
class Person {
  #age; // private property

  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.#age = age;
  }

  getAge() {
    return this.#age;
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", 30);
console.log(john.getAge()); // 30
```

### 6. **Abstraction**

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object.

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make) {
    this.make = make;
    this.engineStarted = false;
  }

  startCar() {
    this.#startEngine();
    console.log(`${this.make} is ready to go!`);
  }

  // Private method (internal details hidden)
  #startEngine() {
    console.log("Starting the engine...");
    this.engineStarted = true;
  }
}

// Usage
const myCar = new Car("Toyota");
myCar.startCar();

// myCar.#startEngine(); ❌ Error! (cannot access private method)
```

In JavaScript, this is often done via interfaces (in TypeScript) or through design patterns.

## Why Use OOP?

- **Modularity**: Code is organized into discrete objects.
- **Reusability**: Once a behavior is defined in a class, it can be reused across projects.
- **Scalability**: Easier to manage growing codebases.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug, enhance, and refactor.

## Final Thoughts

OOP is not just a way of coding — it's a way of thinking about software.
Understanding OOP can help you build more organized, efficient, and powerful applications.

Remember: **Think in terms of real-world objects and their interactions.** Once you grasp that mindset, OOP will feel natural!
