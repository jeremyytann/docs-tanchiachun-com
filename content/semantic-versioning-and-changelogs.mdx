## What is Semantic Versioning?

**Semantic Versioning** (often abbreviated as **SemVer**) is a versioning system that helps developers convey meaning about the underlying changes in a software release.

A semantic version number is structured as:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

* **MAJOR** version when you make **incompatible API changes**
* **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a **backward-compatible** manner
* **PATCH** version when you make **backward-compatible bug fixes**

### Example: SemVer

```
1.4.2
```

* 1 → Major version
* 4 → Minor version (new features added)
* 2 → Patch version (bug fixes only)

### Example: Pre-release and Build Metadata

SemVer also supports optional metadata:

```
1.0.0-alpha+001
```

* `alpha` = pre-release label
* `+001` = build metadata

## Why Use Semantic Versioning?

* Sets clear expectations for users
* Improves dependency management in package ecosystems
* Communicates impact and urgency of updates
* Prevents accidental breakage in integrations

---

## What is a Changelog?

A **changelog** is a file (commonly named `CHANGELOG.md`) that records **notable changes** in a project. It's intended for developers and users to quickly see what’s new, fixed, or changed.

---

## Why Keep a Changelog?

* **Transparency**: Users and contributors can see what’s changed and why.
* **Collaboration**: Helps teams coordinate changes and understand the evolution of the codebase.
* **User Communication**: Provides clear documentation for version upgrades, including breaking changes or new features.
* **Debugging**: When bugs appear, changelogs offer clues on when regressions may have been introduced.

---

## What Makes a Good Changelog?
A good changelog is:

* **Human-readable**: Avoid raw Git commit logs. Summarize meaningfully.
* **Structured**: Group changes into categories like `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, and `Security`.
* **Consistent**: Use the same format for every release.
* **Versioned**: Clearly associate entries with specific version numbers.
* **Dated**: Include the release date for each version.

### Example: Changelog (Using Keep a Changelog Format)

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2025-05-24

### Added
- Support for uploading multiple images in user profiles.
- New dashboard filters by region.

### Changed
- Upgraded `axios` from 0.21.1 to 1.2.3.
- Refactored authentication flow for better performance.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where dark mode wouldn't persist after refresh.

### Security
- Patched XSS vulnerability on the comment section.
```

## Best Practices for Changelogs

* Use Keep a Changelog format.
* Always tag your versions in Git:

```bash
  git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
  git push origin v1.2.0
```

* Keep a CHANGELOG.md file at the root of your project.

## Final Thoughts

Semantic versioning and well-maintained changelogs enhance collaboration, reliability, and trust. They help your software tell a clear story — one version at a time.
