## What Are Mutable Objects?
Mutable objects are those whose **state (values) can be modified** after the object is created. This means you can update properties or elements of a mutable object, and those changes are reflected in the same object without creating a new instance.

### Advantages of Mutable Objects
- **Memory Efficiency:** Mutable objects allow modifications **in-place**, which can save memory.
- **Flexibility:** They allow dynamic changes, making them suitable for scenarios that require frequent modifications.
- **Performance:** In some cases, modifying an existing object is faster than creating a new one.

### Example: Mutable Objects:
In JavaScript, objects and arrays are **mutable** by default:
```javascript
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
person.age = 26;  // Modifying the object
console.log(person); // { name: "Alice", age: 26 }
```

## What Are Immutable Objects?
Immutable objects, on the other hand, **cannot be changed** after creation. Any operation that seems to modify an immutable object actually **creates a new object** with the updated state instead of altering the original.

### Advantages of Immutable Objects
- **Predictability:** Since values never change, there's less risk of unintended modifications and debugging becomes easier.
- **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects prevent race conditions in concurrent applications because their state can't change.
- **Hashability:** Since their values don't change, immutable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.

### Example: Immutable Objects:
In JavaScript, primitive types such as `string`, `number`, and `boolean` are immutable:

```javascript
let str = "Hello";
str[0] = "h";  // No effect
console.log(str); // "Hello"
```

To work with immutable objects in JavaScript, you can use **Object.freeze()** or spread operators to create a new object:

```javascript
const obj = Object.freeze({ name: "Bob" });
obj.name = "Charlie";  // This won't change the object
console.log(obj.name); // "Bob"
```

## When to Use Mutable and Immutable Objects
- **Use Mutable Objects** when performance and memory efficiency are critical, such as updating a large dataset frequently.
- **Use Immutable Objects** when maintaining state consistency is important, such as in functional programming or React state management.

By understanding when and where to use **mutable and immutable** objects, developers can write more efficient and predictable code.
