## What is a Higher-Order Function?  
In React, a **higher-order function (HOF)** is a function that takes a **component** as an argument and returns a **new enhanced component** with additional **props** or **behavior**. This pattern is commonly used for **code reuse, logic abstraction, and component composition**.

Higher-order functions are **not part of the React API** but a **JavaScript pattern** frequently used in React development.

## How Are Higher-Order Functions Used?
Higher-order functions serve multiple purposes in React applications:

1. **Reusing Component Logic**  
   - Encapsulate common logic or behavior and apply it to multiple components.  
2. **Prop Manipulation**  
   - Add, modify, or filter props before passing them to the wrapped component.  
3. **Conditional Rendering**  
   - Render components dynamically based on specific conditions.  
4. **Authentication Handling**  
   - Enforce authentication logic before rendering a component.  
5. **State Management**  
   - Manage and provide state to multiple components or handle state updates.

## Advantages of Higher-Order Functions

1. **Reusability**  
   - Promote **code reuse** by encapsulating logic that can be applied to multiple components.  
2. **Composition**  
   - Enable **component composition**, allowing developers to build complex components by combining simpler ones.  
3. **Abstraction of Concerns**  
   - Separate concerns like **data fetching, authentication, or state management** from the presentation layer.  
4. **Props Manipulation**  
   - Modify or enhance props before passing them to the wrapped component.

---

## Disadvantages of Higher-Order Functions

1. **Prop Drilling**  
   - Can introduce **prop drilling**, making the component tree **harder to understand**.  
2. **Naming Collisions**  
   - May cause **naming conflicts** if not structured properly, leading to **hard-to-debug** issues.  
3. **Increased Complexity**  
   - Overuse of HOFs can result in **deeply nested and hard-to-maintain** components.

## Example: Higher-Order Function

Below is an example of a **higher-order function** that adds an authentication check to a component:

```tsx
import React from "react";

// Higher-Order Function: WithAuth
const withAuth = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    const isAuthenticated = true; // Assume authentication logic here

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      return <h2>Access Denied. Please log in.</h2>;
    }

    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
};

// Regular component
const Dashboard = () => {
  return <h2>Welcome to the Dashboard!</h2>;
};

// Enhanced component using HOF
const ProtectedDashboard = withAuth(Dashboard);

export default function App() {
  return <ProtectedDashboard />;
}
