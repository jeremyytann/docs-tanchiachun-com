## Introduction

In the world of cybersecurity, **hashing** is like creating a digital fingerprint of data. It plays a vital role in protecting sensitive information such as passwords, digital signatures, and even ensuring the integrity of files.

In this guide, we’ll walk through what hashing is, how it works, its differences from encryption, and where it's commonly used.

## What is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of converting any input (like a string, file, or message) into a fixed-size string of characters, which usually looks like a random combination of letters and numbers. This result is known as a **hash value** or **digest**.

### Example: Hashing

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
hash.update('mypassword');
console.log(hash.digest('hex'));
// Output: e.g., "89b1...d7fc"
```

## Why is Hashing Important?

- **Password Security** — Hashing ensures stored passwords aren’t saved in plain text.
- **Data Integrity** — Verify if data was modified (e.g. file downloads).
- **Digital Signatures** — Ensures the authenticity of digital documents.
- **Efficient Lookups** — Used in data structures like hash tables.

## Properties of a Good Hash Function

1. **Deterministic** — Same input always gives the same output.
2. **Fast to Compute** — Efficient for large-scale use.
3. **Irreversible** — Can’t reverse the hash back to the original input.
4. **Collision Resistant** — Two inputs shouldn’t produce the same output.
5. **Avalanche Effect** — Small change in input changes hash drastically.

## Common Hashing Algorithms

| Algorithm  | Output Size | Usage                         |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| MD5       | 128-bit     | Deprecated, legacy systems    |
| SHA-1     | 160-bit     | Deprecated, weak collision    |
| SHA-256   | 256-bit     | Secure, used in blockchain    |
| SHA-3     | 256-bit+    | Modern alternative            |
| bcrypt    | Variable    | Password hashing              |
| scrypt    | Variable    | Resource-intensive password hashing |

## Hashing vs Encryption

| Feature        | Hashing                   | Encryption                |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Direction      | One-way (irreversible)    | Two-way (reversible)      |
| Purpose        | Integrity & verification  | Confidentiality           |
| Use Case       | Passwords, file checksums | Messages, data storage    |
| Output Length  | Fixed                     | Variable                  |

## Where Hashing is Used

- Storing secure passwords in databases
- Verifying file integrity during downloads
- Digital signatures for documents
- Cryptographic operations (e.g. blockchain, authentication tokens)

---

## Salting: Strengthening Password Hashing

A **salt** is a random value added to passwords before hashing to defend against dictionary and rainbow table attacks.

```js
const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
const password = 'mypassword';
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
hash.update(password + salt);
console.log(hash.digest('hex'));
```

---

## Conclusion

Hashing is a foundational concept in data security. While it's not a silver bullet, when used correctly, especially with salting, it can be incredibly effective for protecting sensitive information.
