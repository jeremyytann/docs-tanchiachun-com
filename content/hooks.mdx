## What are Hooks?
In React, **hooks** are functions that allow functional components to manage **state, lifecycle events, and side effects**. They enable developers to use stateful logic in functional components without the need for class-based syntax. Hooks improve **code reusability**, **readability**, and make it easier to share logic across components.

---

## Why Were Hooks Introduced?  
React introduced hooks to solve several challenges with class components:

1. **Complex Code with Constructors**  
   - Class components require **constructors** and **lifecycle methods** to manage state, making the code complex.  
   - Hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` simplify state management in **functional components**.

2. **Reusability of Logic**  
   - Stateful logic in class components is **not easily reusable** across multiple components.  
   - **Custom hooks** allow developers to encapsulate and share logic without needing **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** or **Render Props**.

3. **Simplified Lifecycle Management**  
   - Lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` can be **confusing** and prone to **bugs**.  
   - The `useEffect` hook provides a **unified way** to handle **side effects** in functional components.

4. **Performance Optimization Challenges**  
   - Class components had **limitations** in optimizing performance.  
   - Hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` provide **better control over memoization**, preventing **unnecessary re-renders**.

Hooks enhance React’s development experience by making functional components **more readable, scalable, and maintainable**.

## Difference Between useCallback and useMemo
The `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks are similar but serve different purposes:

- **`useCallback`** → Returns a **memoized function**.
  - Used to **cache a function definition** between re-renders.
- **`useMemo`** → Returns a **memoized value**.
  - Used to **cache the result of a computation** between re-renders.

## Example: Using useCallback and useMemo

```tsx
import { useCallback, useMemo, useState } from "react";

function ExampleComponent({ items }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // useMemo caches a computed value
  const computedValue = useMemo(() => {
    return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
  }, [items]);

  // useCallback caches a function reference
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Total Price: {computedValue}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment ({count})</button>
    </div>
  );
}
