## What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML elements that provide meaningful information about the content and structure of a webpage. Instead of relying on generic tags like `<div>` and `<span>`, semantic HTML utilizes elements that describe their purpose, making the content more understandable for browsers, developers, and assistive technologies.

## Why is Semantic HTML Important?
### 1. Accessibility
Semantic HTML enhances accessibility by allowing assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to interpret content more effectively. This improves the browsing experience for users with disabilities.

### 2. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Search engines use semantic HTML to better understand webpage content. Properly structured pages with meaningful tags improve search engine rankings, leading to better visibility.

### 3. Code Readability & Maintainability
Using semantic tags makes the code more readable, structured, and maintainable. Developers can easily understand the purpose of different elements, making collaboration and updates more efficient.

## Common Semantic HTML Elements and Their Purpose
Here are some key semantic HTML elements and their roles:

| Tag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `<header>` | Defines the header section of a document or section. |
| `<nav>` | Represents navigation links. |
| `<section>` | Groups related content within a document. |
| `<article>` | Represents self-contained content, such as a blog post or news article. |
| `<aside>` | Defines content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars. |
| `<footer>` | Represents the footer section, typically containing metadata or links. |
| `<main>` | Identifies the main content of the document. |
| `<figure>` | Encapsulates media like images, diagrams, or code snippets, along with captions using `<figcaption>`. |

## Example: Using Semantic HTML
Instead of writing:
```html
<div class="header">My Website</div>

<div class="nav">
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#">About</a>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This is my website.</p>
</div>

<div class="footer">
  &copy; 2025 My Website
</div>
```

Use semantic HTML:
```html
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
</header>

<nav>
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#">About</a>
</nav>

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This is my website.</p>
  </section>
</main>

<footer>
  &copy; 2025 My Website
</footer>
```

## Best Practices for Semantic HTML
- Use semantic elements where applicable, instead of `<div>` or `<span>`.
- Structure your document logically with headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
- Ensure elements are used correctly (e.g., `<article>` for self-contained content).
- Combine semantic elements with ARIA roles when additional accessibility support is needed.

By incorporating semantic HTML, you create more meaningful, accessible, and maintainable web pages that benefit both users and developers.
