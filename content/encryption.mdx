## What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting **plain text** (readable data) into **cipher text** (scrambled data) using a specific algorithm and key. Only someone with the correct key can reverse the process and read the original message.

### Example:

Imagine you want to send a secret note to your friend:

- **Plain text**: “Meet me at 3PM.”
- **Encrypted** (with Caesar cipher): “Phhw ph dw 3SP.”

<Callout>
  Only your friend, who knows the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) rule, can decode it.
</Callout>

## Why is Encryption Important?

Encryption protects sensitive data from unauthorized access. 

Here’s why it’s critical:
- **Privacy** — Keeps messages, emails, and documents confidential. It ensures that only the intended recipient can read the contents, even if someone intercepts the data in transit.
- **Security** — Protects financial transactions and passwords. Encryption safeguards sensitive data such as credit card numbers, login credentials, and health records from being accessed or misused by attackers.
- **Integrity** — Prevents data tampering. Encryption ensures that the data hasn’t been altered during transmission, preserving its original state.
- **Compliance** — Meets regulatory requirements (like GDPR, HIPAA). Many industries are legally required to implement encryption to protect consumer data and avoid heavy fines.

## Types of Encryption

### Symmetric Encryption

- Uses **one key** to encrypt and decrypt.
- Fast and efficient for large amounts of data.
- Example algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const key = crypto.randomBytes(32);
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', key, iv);
let encrypted = cipher.update('Hello world', 'utf8', 'hex');
encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
```

### Asymmetric Encryption

- Uses a **pair of keys**: public (to encrypt) and private (to decrypt).
- Common in HTTPS, email encryption.
- Example algorithm: RSA

```js
const { generateKeyPairSync, publicEncrypt, privateDecrypt } = require('crypto');
const { publicKey, privateKey } = generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
  modulusLength: 2048,
});

const data = Buffer.from("Secret");
const encrypted = publicEncrypt(publicKey, data);
const decrypted = privateDecrypt(privateKey, encrypted);
```

## Where Encryption is Used

- Messaging apps (e.g. WhatsApp, Signal)
- Websites (HTTPS)
- Password storage (bcrypt, scrypt)
- Online banking
- VPN and secure browsing

## Common Encryption Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type        | Common Use                |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| AES      | Symmetric   | File & disk encryption    |
| RSA      | Asymmetric  | Secure key exchange       |
| ECC      | Asymmetric  | Efficient mobile encryption |
| SHA-256  | Hashing     | Blockchain, data integrity |
| bcrypt   | Hashing     | Password storage          |

## Hashing vs. Encryption

Hashing is **one-way** and irreversible. Encryption is **two-way**.

| Feature       | Encryption         | Hashing           |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Reversible    | Yes (with key)     | No                 |
| Use Case      | Messaging, files   | Password storage   |
| Example Algo  | AES, RSA           | SHA-256, bcrypt    |

## Conclusion

Encryption is all around us — from securing your bank app to protecting chats with your friends. Understanding the basics of how it works is essential in today’s digital age.

Stay secure, and remember: if it’s not encrypted, it’s not private.
