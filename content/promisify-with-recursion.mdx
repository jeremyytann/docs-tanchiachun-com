## What is Promisify?

In JavaScript, **promisify** refers to converting a function that follows the **traditional callback-style asynchronous pattern** into a function that **returns a Promise**.

This is useful when working with legacy APIs or functions that rely on callbacks, as Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous operations.

## Implementing Promisify with Recursion

Here, we define an example where a list of Promises is executed **recursively**, ensuring that each Promise resolves before moving on to the next.

### Example: Recursive Promise Execution

```javascript
const promiseList = [
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    console.log("Promise 1 resolved.");
    resolve("Promise 1 resolved.");
  }),
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    console.log("Promise 2 resolved.");
    resolve("Promise 2 resolved.");
  }),
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    console.log("Promise 3 resolved.");
    resolve("Promise 3 resolved.");
  }),
];

function promiseFunc(promiseList, index = 0) {
  if (index >= promiseList.length) {
    console.log("All promises resolved.");
    return Promise.resolve("Done.");
  }

  return promiseList[index].then(() => {
    return promiseFunc(promiseList, index + 1);
  });
}

promiseFunc(promiseList).then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Explanation
1. **Base Case:** If `index` is greater than or equal to the length of `promiseList`, the function resolves with "Done." and stops execution.
2. **Recursive Case:** The function executes the current Promise and then **recursively calls itself** with the next index.
3. **Ensures Sequential Execution:** Each Promise **waits** for the previous one to complete before proceeding.
4. **Returns a Promise:** The function always returns a Promise, making it chainable.

## Why Use Recursion?
- Ensures **each asynchronous operation completes** before starting the next.
- Eliminates the need for loops with `await`, keeping the code **functional and clean**.
- Works well when handling **dynamic lists** of asynchronous tasks.

By applying **promisify with recursion**, we can create **better control flow** for async operations in JavaScript.
