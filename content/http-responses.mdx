## What is an HTTP Response?

An **HTTP response** is the message sent by a server back to a client (usually a browser or mobile app) after receiving an HTTP request. It includes important information about the result of the request — whether it succeeded, failed, or needs further action.

Understanding HTTP responses is crucial for debugging issues, building reliable APIs, and optimizing web performance.

---

## Structure of an HTTP Response

An HTTP response typically consists of three main parts:

### 1. **Status Line**

Indicates the outcome of the request.

**Example:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

- `HTTP/1.1`: The HTTP version.
- `200`: The status code.
- `OK`: The status message.

### 2. **Headers**

Metadata about the response.

**Examples:**

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 512
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

Headers provide information like content type, cache policies, server info, cookies, and more.

### 3. **Body**

The actual data returned from the server.

**Example (JSON response):**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Jeremy",
  "role": "Developer"
}
```

The body is optional and depends on the request type and status.

## Common HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are grouped into five classes:

### 1xx: Informational

- `100 Continue` – Indicates that the initial part of the request has been received.
- `101 Switching Protocols` – The server is switching to a different protocol.
- `102 Processing` *(WebDAV)* – The server has received and is processing the request.
- `103 Early Hints` – Preload resources while waiting for the final response.

### 2xx: Success

- `200 OK` – Standard response for a successful HTTP request.
- `201 Created` – A resource was successfully created.
- `202 Accepted` – The request was accepted but not yet processed.
- `203 Non-Authoritative Information` – Metadata returned from a third-party.
- `204 No Content` – The request was successful but returns no content.
- `205 Reset Content` – Tells the client to reset the document view.
- `206 Partial Content` – Partial GET request succeeded.
- `207 Multi-Status` *(WebDAV)* – Multiple status codes returned for multiple operations.

### 3xx: Redirection

- `300 Multiple Choices` – Multiple options for the resource.
- `301 Moved Permanently` – This resource has been permanently moved.
- `302 Found` – Resource temporarily moved.
- `303 See Other` – See another URI with GET.
- `304 Not Modified` – Cached version is still valid.
- `305 Use Proxy` – Must access through proxy (deprecated).
- `307 Temporary Redirect` – Temporarily redirected; method preserved.
- `308 Permanent Redirect` – Permanently redirected; method preserved.

### 4xx: Client Errors

- `400 Bad Request` – The request was malformed.
- `401 Unauthorized` – Authentication is required.
- `402 Payment Required` – Reserved for future use.
- `403 Forbidden` – You don’t have permission.
- `404 Not Found` – Resource not found.
- `405 Method Not Allowed` – HTTP method not allowed.
- `406 Not Acceptable` – Cannot respond with acceptable content.
- `407 Proxy Authentication Required` – Proxy authentication needed.
- `408 Request Timeout` – Client took too long to send request.
- `409 Conflict` – Request conflicts with current server state.
- `410 Gone` – Resource is permanently gone.
- `411 Length Required` – Content-Length header required.
- `412 Precondition Failed` – Conditions in headers not met.
- `413 Payload Too Large` – Request body too large.
- `414 URI Too Long` – URI is too long for the server.
- `415 Unsupported Media Type` – Media type not supported.
- `416 Range Not Satisfiable` – Requested range not available.
- `417 Expectation Failed` – Expect header failed.
- `418 I'm a teapot` – April Fools' joke RFC.
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` – Syntax is correct, but semantics are wrong.
- `429 Too Many Requests` – Rate limiting exceeded.

### 5xx: Server Errors

- `500 Internal Server Error` – A generic server error.
- `501 Not Implemented` – Feature not implemented.
- `502 Bad Gateway` – Invalid response from upstream server.
- `503 Service Unavailable` – Server is down or overloaded.
- `504 Gateway Timeout` – Upstream server timeout.
- `505 HTTP Version Not Supported` – HTTP version not supported.
- `507 Insufficient Storage` – Not enough storage space.
- `508 Loop Detected` – Infinite loop detected (WebDAV).
- `510 Not Extended` – Further extensions are required.
- `511 Network Authentication Required` – Network login required.

## What is WebDAV?

**WebDAV** (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that allows clients to perform remote web content authoring operations. It enables features like:

- Creating, editing, and deleting files on a remote server
- Managing document properties (like author, creation date)
- Locking resources to prevent overwrites during editing
- Handling collections (e.g., folders and directories)

Many HTTP status codes like `102`, `207`, `422`, `507`, and `508` were introduced specifically to support WebDAV operations. It's commonly used in collaborative tools, CMS systems, and networked file management systems.

## Example: HTTP Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 86
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "message": "Welcome back!",
  "user": {
    "id": 42,
    "name": "Jeremy"
  }
}
```

## Why Understanding HTTP Responses Matters

- **Debugging**: Interpreting status codes helps pinpoint where things go wrong.
- **Security**: Proper use of 401/403/429 can improve API security.
- **Performance**: Effective use of 304 or 204 can enhance client efficiency.
- **API Design**: Clear, consistent responses improve developer experience.

## Final Thoughts

HTTP responses are at the heart of every client-server interaction on the web. Whether you're building REST APIs, working with frontends, or debugging network issues, a solid grasp of status codes and response structures will save you time — and many headaches.

Whenever in doubt, remember: **what the server says back matters just as much as what the client asks for**.
