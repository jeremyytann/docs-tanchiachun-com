## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- A Firebase project
- A GitHub repository
- Node.js installed

---

## Step 1: Install Firebase Tools

Run the command below on the project's root directory to install Firebase Tools locally:

```sh
npm install firebase-tools -D
```

<Callout>
  Install Firebase tools locally ensures consistency across environments and avoids version conflicts.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Initialize Firebase Hosting

Run the command below, which prompts you to authenticate with Firebase using your Google account:

```sh
npx firebase login
```

<Callout>
  Make sure to use the same Google account associated with the Firebase project.
</Callout>

Next, run the command below and complete the initialization for Firebase Hosting:

```sh
npx firebase init hosting
```

<Callout>
  The default **public directory** is **build** for **React.js**, and **out** for **Next.js**.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  The **single-page app** option is **Yes** for **React.js**, and **No** for **Next.js**.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  The **automatic builds and deploys with GitHub Actions** option should be **No**. It will be added later.
</Callout>

Then, modify the `next config` file to enable static export:
<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']}>
  <Tab value="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    // next.config.ts
    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
      output: 'export'
    };
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="JavaScript">
    ```js
    // next.config.mjs
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export'
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

And also modify the `firebase.json` file by adding the code section below
in the hosting section to prevent the routing issue on refresh 
for static Next.js websites deployed to Firebase Hosting:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    ...,
    "cleanUrls": true,
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "/**", 
        "dynamicLinks": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Lastly, run the following commands to build and deploy the project to Firebase Hosting:

```sh
npm run build
```

```sh
npx firebase deploy --only hosting
```

The `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json` files are Firebase configuration files. 
`.firebaserc` contains project deployment configurations, 
while `firebase.json` defines server settings, redirects, and headers.

## Step 3: Setup GitHub Actions (Optional)

You may setup GitHub Actions to deploy your website to Firebase Hosting
when there are changes pushed to the GitHub repository.

Run the command below and complete the setup for GitHub Actions:
```sh
npx firebase init hosting:github
```

<Callout>
  Select **Yes** for the **Setup build workflow**.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  Enter the build script **npm install & npm run build**.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  The **Auto-deploy on PR merge** option is optional. Choose as per project requirements.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Push to GitHub

Commit and push the code to the GitHub repository to trigger 
the GitHub Actions workflow (if configured) or deploy manually 
using the Firebase CLI in Step 2.

---

That's it! The static Next.js website is now hosted on Firebase 
Hosting with automated deployment via GitHub Actions.
