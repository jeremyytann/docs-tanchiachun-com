## What is Memoization?

Memoization is a performance optimization technique that **caches the results** of expensive function calls. If the inputs don't change, memoization returns the previously stored result instead of recalculating it.

In React, memoization is crucial for preventing unnecessary re-renders, especially in large applications.

---

## Why is Memoization Important in React?

React components re-render when props or state change. Sometimes, these renders are unnecessary and can hurt performance — especially when:

- Components render large lists.
- Expensive calculations are repeated.
- Functions or props change frequently, triggering children to re-render.

Memoization helps solve these issues by:

- Skipping re-renders when inputs haven't changed.
- Caching computed values.
- Preventing unnecessary function recreation.

## React.memo

`React.memo` is a **Higher Order Component** that memoizes a **functional component**.

### Use React.memo when:
- Your component **renders the same output** given the same props.

### Example: Using React.memo

```jsx
const Greeting = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Greeting rendered");
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
});

// Only re-renders if `name` changes.
```

## 2. useMemo

`useMemo` memoizes **a computed value**, and only recalculates it when its dependencies change.

### Use useMemo when:
- You have **expensive computations** inside a component.

### Example: Using useMemo

```jsx
const ExpensiveComponent = ({ num }) => {
  const squared = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating square");
    return num * num;
  }, [num]);

  return <div>Square: {squared}</div>;
};
```

---

## 3. useCallback

`useCallback` memoizes **a function**, and only recreates it when its dependencies change.

### Use useCallback when:
- You're passing **callbacks to child components**.
- You want to **prevent child re-renders** due to new function references.

### Example: Using useCallback

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  }, []);

  return <Child onClick={handleClick} />;
};
```

## Memoization Best Practices

- Avoid premature optimization — **measure performance first**.
- Don’t overuse `useMemo` or `useCallback` — they add complexity.
- Use memoization when:
  - Computations are expensive.
  - Props/functions cause unnecessary re-renders.
- Wrap components with `React.memo` when their props are stable.

---

## Final Thoughts

Memoization can dramatically improve performance in React apps when used wisely. Mastering `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` helps you write faster, smarter components.

Remember: **If it’s not slow, don’t memoize!**
